              I am a recent graduate of Stanislaus State University, where I
              earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a
              concentration in Computer Information Systems. Initially, I
              believed Information Technology was the right path for me.
              However, as I delved deeper into the field, I realized my true
              passion lay elsewhere within the realm of computers. I love
              working with computers and am eager to bring ideas to life.

              This realization led me to explore web development further,
              prompting me to enroll in a course with Bay Valley Tech, a
              non-profit organization. Through this transformative experience, I
              gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node,
              MongoDB, SQL, Git, Github, and developed a comprehensive
              understanding of programming and software development.

            <p>
              I'm currently part of BizzNEST’s internship program, where I work
              on client projects that include maintaining websites, building
              software solutions, and improving systems for better efficiency.
              Through this experience, I’m continuously sharpening my skills
              with the tech stack I’m familiar with and learning how to apply
              them effectively in real-world scenarios. Once the internship
              concludes, my goal is to secure a full-time position and continue
              growing in the tech industry.
