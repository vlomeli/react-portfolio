              <p>
                I am a recent graduate of Stanislaus State University, where I
                earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a
                concentration in Computer Information Systems. Initially, I
                believed Information Technology was the right path for me.
                However, as I delved deeper into the field, I realized my true
                passion lay elsewhere within the realm of computers. I love
                working with computers and am eager to bring ideas to life.

            <div className="card2 about-card2">
              <h1>WHERE I AM NOW</h1>
              <p>
                This realization led me to explore web development further,
                prompting me to enroll in a course with Bay Valley Tech, a
                non-profit organization. Through this transformative experience,
                I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap,
                UI Design, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, Git, and developed a
                comprehensive understanding of programming and software
                development.

              <h1>GOAL</h1>
              <p>
                My goal is to continue honing my skills with the current tech
                stack I am familiar with, enabling me to apply these skills
                effectively in future job tasks. I am currently enrolled in Bay
                Valley Tech's internship program, where I am applying my skill
                set to real-world projects. Once the internship concludes, I aim
                to secure a full-time position and advance within the industry.
                To achieve this, I will remain actively involved, ask questions
                when necessary, and eagerly participate in project discussions.
