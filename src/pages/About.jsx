    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> I am a recent graduate of Stanislaus State University, holding a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration 
            in Computer Information Systems. Initially aspiring to embark on a career as a computer technician, 
            my journey led me to a realization â€“ 
            I wanted to do more. It was during my college courses that I was introduced to coding, sparking a newfound passion.
        </p>

        <p> Post-graduation, I decided to further explore this passion by enrolling
            in the Bay Valley Tech Code Academy Program. Through this transformative experience, I 
            acquired proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, UI Design, as well as a 
            comprehensive understanding of programming and software development as a whole.
        </p>
        <p> Now, I am actively pursuing my dreams as a Junior Web Developer, armed with a solid 
            foundation and a diverse skill set. This journey has not only broadened my horizons but 
            has empowered me to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic field of web development.
